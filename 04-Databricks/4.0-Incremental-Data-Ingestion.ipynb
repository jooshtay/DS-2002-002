    "### Incremental Data Ingestion with Auto Loader\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark Structured Streaming is a feature of Apache Spark that enables for simplified configuration when processing incremental datasets. Historically, streaming big data has been driven by the need to reduce latency for the sake of providing near real-time analytics; however, this lesson focuses more on implementing incremental data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not absolutely required when working with a *data lakehouse*, many enterprise implementations will derive substantial benefit from incremental data processing. Incremental ETL is important since it allows us to deal solely with new data that has been encountered since the last ingestion. Reliably processing only the new data reduces redundant processing and helps enterprises reliably scale data pipelines.  The first step for any successful data lakehouse implementation is ingesting into a Delta Lake table from cloud storage. Historically, ingesting files from a data lake into a database has been a complicated process; however, Databricks Auto Loader provides an easy-to-use mechanism for incrementally and efficiently processing new data files as they arrive in cloud file storage. Due to the benefits and scalability that Auto Loader delivers, Databricks recommends its use as general **best practice** when ingesting data from cloud object storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "* Execute Auto Loader code to incrementally ingest data from cloud storage to Delta Lake\n",
    "* Describe what happens when a new file arrives in a directory configured for Auto Loader\n",
    "* Query a table fed by a streaming Auto Loader query\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.0. Import Shared Utilities and Data Files\n",
    "This lab will demonstrate ingesting artificially generated medical data, in JSON format, that simulates heart rate monitor signals captured from numerous devices; therefore, this data represents what would be expected from a *Streaming* data source.\n",
